Formake is a generic build system template OR build system from scratch project.

NOTE: current Formake status is 'it is already usable but in early stage of development'.

Formake provides generic project that builds several executables and libraries.

Formake declares to be bloatless, portable, conform to known UNIX standards and be
simple in sense of using only standard Shell and Make.
Formake is for those power users and developer that know and respect Shell and Make.

It is expected that user takes Formake template project and tunes it to his needs.

Formake builds system must be able to run on most modern and/or widely used systems.
It covers 99.99**% of all systems.

Formake intentionally ignores support of very old, hardly specialized systems that are
not widely adopted. It is in order to be not another Autohell.

Formake declares several principles:
  * no need to invent new automation tool when we have Shell
  * no need to use any other scripting language when we have Shell
  * no need to use freaky Make extentions when we have ...
  * use standard Make and write Make rules manually when no automation is required
  * use Shell to automate Makefile generation only in parts and only when it is really needed (sometimes it is)

Of course Shell does not replace Make. Make itself is good but lacks automation for
configurations that are little more complex than Hello Word project. Normally most of Makefile can be
written in standard Make language. Make is declarative language. This is good for simple parts but
not enough when we need conditional setup. For example, based on compiler type we must select
proper C flags. One solution is to generate global config.mk that will be included by Makefiles. This
solution works but more convenient and flexible approach would be to put the whole Makefile inside
Shell script, mkmf script, and in this file we can wrap Makefile script inside here-document. So we wrap
Makefile in Shell and thus extend solely declarative Make with imperative full fledged programming
language. In mkmf we use Make language in most parts and get simplicity and readibility, and use Shell where
we need some sort of automation and there we get Shell power.

Normal build system configuration is split on 2 stages:
  * configuration stage
  * Makefile generation stage

Configuration stage is concentrated in toplevel 'configure' script.
Makefile generation stage is spread in many scripts that generate Makefiles in
subdirectories. In Formake such scripts are named 'mkmf'. Every mkmf script
generates one Makefile. All scripts are chained. It means that every mkmf script
runs other mkmf scripts in it's subdirectories starting from toplevel mkmf. Toplevel
configure script starts toplevel mkmf script and the call-chain goes down the build
project hierarchy. So we get a tree of correctly generated Makefiles.

First of all, 'configure' script must be written manually, it must be simple. It be
structures and be easy to read. 'configure' performs the following 2 base tasks:
  * test dependencies
  * configure build system

configure script is split on the following parts:
  - base configuration variables at the head. Such variables define base project parameters:
    name, version etc.
  - parse user options. Formake 'configure' provides standard 'GNU configure' options for C/C++
    projects.
  - probe host system parameters. It is performed using 'pofig' script. It gives everything you
    need to know about build host.
  - check dependencies: tools, compilers, libraries. It is performed using cmdok, cprobe, cltest
    and cppdef scripts. If your project depends on any tools or libraries, these scripts are
    what you need.
  - generate build configuration file, build.conf. This config file contains configuration
    variables global for the whole build system. Other build scripts include it to get data
    about host system, compiler, user options, found dependencies etc.
  - run Makefiles generation. Makefiles are generated using 'mkmf' chained scripts.
